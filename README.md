# SDF07 Project

This is the readme file for the CodeSpace Pets Instagram project 

## Description

The purpose of the project was to style the provided HTML file into a responsive instagram tempplate, using CSS. 

## Design Choices 

The instagram template is something everyone knows and sees all the time so it was easy to have a frame of reference. 

However when it came to choosing wether to use flex box or grid was quite challenging, as they both have their unique properties. 

At the end I chose to use grid for my gallery section because it was much easier to understand and grasp. Furthermore it provided the necessary properties for the images to be responsive without having to add on any media queries. 

The profile section was the most challenging, because it required different blocks to be moved around into the appropriate positions. 

At the end I chose to use flexbox as it allowed for the most flexibility, in allowing me to position the different sections in their appropriate positions. 

## Features 

Overall i was quite pleased with the way the instagram template came out, some of the featueres i was particularly proud of are: 

* the hover effect with the box shadow when viewing the likes and comments  
* the loader at the end of the page and learning how to create that. 

## Technologies Used 

* CSS for styling the page
